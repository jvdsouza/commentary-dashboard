# Esports Commentary Dashboard - Monorepo

A comprehensive dashboard for esports commentators to track player data, tournament progress, and real-time match information. Built with React and TypeScript frontend, Express backend with smart caching, and integrated with start.gg API.

## 📁 Architecture

This is a **monorepo** using pnpm workspaces with three packages:

- **`@commentary/frontend`** - React + TypeScript UI (`packages/frontend/`)
- **`@commentary/backend`** - Express BFF with smart caching (`packages/backend/`)
- **`@commentary/shared`** - Shared TypeScript types (`packages/shared/`)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install pnpm (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
# or
brew install pnpm  # macOS
# or
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -  # Linux/macOS
```

### 2. Install All Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Backend** - Create `packages/backend/.env`:
```env
STARTGG_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend** - Create `packages/frontend/.env`:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 4. Run Development Servers

**All services (parallel):**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Or individually:**
```bash
pnpm dev:backend    # Runs on :3001
pnpm dev:frontend   # Runs on :5173
```

- pnpm (install with `npm install -g pnpm` or `brew install pnpm`)
- start.gg API token (required)

### Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd commentary-dashboard
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit `.env` and add your start.gg API token:
   ```
   VITE_STARTGG_API_TOKEN=your_start_gg_api_token_here
   ```

### Getting a start.gg API Token

1. Go to [start.gg Developer Portal](https://developer.start.gg/docs/authentication)
2. Create an account and generate an API token
3. Add the token to your `.env` file

### Running the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

## Usage

1. **Load a Tournament**: 
   - Enter a start.gg tournament URL in the input field
   - Optionally specify an event name to focus on a specific event within the tournament
   - Click "Load Tournament"

2. **View Player Information**:
   - Browse categorized players in the sidebar (Major Contenders, New Contenders, Improving Players)
   - Use the search function to find specific players
   - Click on any player to see detailed information including achievements and tournament history

3. **Bracket Visualization**:
   - View current matches in progress
   - Select a player from the dropdown to highlight their path through the bracket
   - See bracket names and round information for all matches

4. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Enable auto-refresh to get updated data every 30 seconds
   - Manually refresh data using the refresh button

## URL Examples

The dashboard supports various start.gg URL formats:

- Tournament overview: `https://www.start.gg/tournament/manila-madness-4/details`
- Specific event: `https://www.start.gg/tournament/manila-madness-4/event/tekken-8-twt-challenger-event`
- Bracket view: `https://www.start.gg/tournament/manila-madness-4/event/tekken-8-twt-challenger-event/brackets/1941086/2850777`

## API Integration

### start.gg API
- Tournament data and brackets
- Player information and match results
- Real-time match status updates

### FGC Tools API
- Player ELO ratings and history
- Tournament performance tracking
- Improvement metrics calculation

Note: If FGC Tools API is unavailable, the dashboard will still function with start.gg data only.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Styling**: CSS with responsive design
- **API Client**: Axios for HTTP requests
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based refresh system

### Security
- API tokens are handled securely through environment variables
- No sensitive user data is exposed in the UI
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

### Performance
- Efficient data fetching with batched API requests
- Optimized re-rendering with React memoization
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Token Error**: Make sure your start.gg API token is correctly set in the `.env` file
2. **CORS Issues**: The application is designed to work with the official APIs - ensure you're not using a development server that blocks cross-origin requests
3. **Loading Issues**: Check your internet connection and verify the tournament URL format
4. **No Player Data**: Some tournaments might have limited participant data available through the API

### Error Messages

The dashboard provides clear error messages for common issues:
- Invalid tournament URLs
- API connectivity problems
- Missing or expired API tokens
- Network connectivity issues
